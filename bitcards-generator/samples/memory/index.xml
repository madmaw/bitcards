<Game title="Memory" blurb="A game for one player. Can you match all the cards?">
    <Description>
        <p>This game is a test of your memory.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuffle all the cards and place the entire deck face-down to one side</li>
            <li>Draw a card (and scan it) and look at it</li>
            <li>Place the card face down somewhere in front of you</li>
            <li>Draw another card (and scan it)</li>
            <li>Does it match a previously drawn card? If so, scan that card (without looking at it), if not place that card face down in front of you</li>
            <li>Repeat until the deck is empty</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once all the cards are gone, you win!</p>
        <p>If you either put down a card that has a match in play or pick the wrong match, you lose and the game ends.</p>
